this simple calculator application with basic arithmetic operations.

The component imports the "useState", "useEffect", and useRef hooks from the React library, as well as a custom CalBody component that handles the display of calculator buttons.

The useState hook is used to manage the state of the result variable, which holds the current value of the calculator display.

The component defines a "handleClick" function that handles button clicks on the calculator. This function performs various operations based on the value of the clicked button. If the clicked button is a number or an arithmetic operator, the value is added to the result state variable. If the clicked button is the equals sign, the current expression in result is evaluated and the result is displayed. If the clicked button is the delete button, the last character in the result state variable is removed.

The "handleChange" function handles changes in the calculator display input field. It first checks if the input value is a number, and if so, sets the result state variable to the input value.

Finally, the component returns a JSX template that displays the calculator input field and the calculator buttons rendered by the "CalBody" component.


THE CALBODY COMPONENT:
The component defines two arrays "numb" and "operands" that contain the values for the calculator number and operand buttons, respectively.
The "CalBody" component takes in a handleClick function as a prop, which is called when a button is clicked.
The component returns a JSX template that displays the number and operand buttons using the map() function. The map() function iterates over each element in the numb and operands arrays and returns a button element for each value. Each button has a value attribute that is set to the corresponding value from the array, and an onClick event listener that calls the handleClick function with the event object as an argument.
The CalBody component is exported as a default export. It can be imported and used in other components App.js to create the calculator button panel.
